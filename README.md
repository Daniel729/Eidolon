# Eidolon

A performant NNUE-powered chess engine written in Rust.

## Features

- Support for the UCI protocol
- (Only) Single-threaded search
- Uses 8 PSQT buckets + a single NNUE network with 2x(768 -> 128) -> 1 architecture, and the clamp(x, 0, 1) ^ 2 activation function
   - Uses runtime CPU detection to choose the best instruction set to use for inference (SSE2 / SSE4.2 / AVX2 / AVX512)
   - The current network was trained on the following data sets
      - [Zurichess's quiet labeled v7](https://bitbucket.org/zurichess/tuner/downloads/) - created by Alexandru MoÈ™oi
      - [Lichess big3 resolved](https://archive.org/details/lichess-big3-resolved.7z) - created by Jay Honnold
      - [Ethereal's data dump](https://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=75350) - created by Andrew Grant
- Uses both bitboards + 8x8 matrix for representing the game's state
- Alpha-beta search with iterative deepening, move ordering, null move pruning, late move reduction, and quiescence searching
- Zobrist hashing, with hashes consistent acrosss compilations. (e.g. the starting position hash is always `2DFBA8745DE39E4F`)
- A transposition table, defaults to 16MB in size
- Very roughly ~3000 ELO per my testing

## Installation

### Build Instructions

   ```bash
   $ cargo build --profile=release-lto --bin eidolon
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the engine in UCI mode:
```
$ ./target/release/eidolon
> position startpos
> go infinite
[...]
> stop
bestmove g1f3
> position startpos
> show

[FEN "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"]
